## Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ’»
### Cyber Security Analyst | Security Researcher
Passionate about low-level security and adversarial techniques.
I dive into malware analysis, reverse engineering, vulnerability research, EDR evasion, and kernel exploitation (ring 0).
Always curious about how things break â€” and how to make them more secure.
